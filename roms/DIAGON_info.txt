Welcome to DIAGON!

For animated sprites, the bullets and enemies that shoot bullets have 3+ frames of looping animation (enemies.c -> updateRanged___()/updateBullets()/updateDummy())
For parallax backgrounds, the splash screen uses 4 backgrounds: 2 static, 2 moving at different speeds (main.c -> splash()/wincutscene())
For tilemap modification, the cracks turning into holes and cutscene at the end of level 7 (game.c -> openDoor(), look at startXYcutscene() at your own risk)
For palette modification, the player's eyes change color when invuln, and the [START] changes color in the win/lose screen (player.c -> updatePlayer(), main.c -> win()/lose())
Digital sound is used for looping background music and non-looping explosion/falling sound effects which layer on top of music (play.c, sound.c)
malloc is used for collision map modification
Fixed point is used for precise movement
Transparency is used in sprites for shadows and glow effects

Instructions:
D-pad to change move: 
    Moving ramps up your velocity in that direction, up to a point
    You will lose speed to friction
A to lay an explosive (max of 3)
B to detonate all explosives
UP and DOWN and A to navigate in splash and pause menus
START to go to splash from win/lose
L and R at the same time to activate the cheat:
    Cheat freezes all enemies for 3 seconds, unable to attack or move

You have 3 lives, and getting hit by an enemy or bullet removes a life and gives short invuln
Every other level, you may regain a life (up to max 3)
You are invulnerable when being boosted by your explosions (dependent on speed)
If you ram into an enemy while invulnerable (red eyes as indicator), they die
You can also place an explosive very close to an enemy and detonate to kill it
Killing enemies only makes it easier to complete levels
To complete a level, explode the cracked part of the floor and go through the hole

You can place multiple explosives and position yourself near them to get a multi-vectored boost
You can go very very fast with multiple explosions
Your distance from the explosion dictates how much speed you get
